Implementing perfect security would be highly inefficient and computationally expensive.
Instead, we must consider that our adversaries have limited resources. 
Therefore, our goal should be to achieve a level of security that is sufficiently "perfect" to resist their attacks, rather than trying to achieve absolute perfection.
