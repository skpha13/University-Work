### Binary Conversion:
**Decimal 13 + 10 = 23**

23 in binary:
```
23 / 2 = 11 remainder 1
11 / 2 = 5 remainder 1
5  / 2 = 2 remainder 1
2  / 2 = 1 remainder 0
1       = 1
```
**Binary representation:** `10111`

Verifying:
```
1x2⁴ + 0x2³ + 1x2² + 1x2¹ + 1x2⁰ = 16 + 0 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 23
```

### Hexadecimal Conversion:
**FFFF in binary:** `1111 1111 1111 1111`

**Binary to Hexadecimal Mapping:**
```
1111  -> F
1111  -> F
1111  -> F
1111  -> F
