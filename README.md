## Bachelor's Thesis

My final year thesis focused on radial image reconstruction, a problem relevant to both medical imaging and artistic rendering. Using a custom implementation of the Radon transform, I explored optimization algorithms to reconstruct images from radial projections, evaluating their visual quality, performance, and memory usage.

The project uses the string art problem as an illustrative case, bridging artistic concepts with mathematical modeling and algorithmic design.
